### Longest Consecutive Sequence ðŸ”¢

 Problem Statement: 

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.

 Input :
An array of integers arr.

 Output :
An integer representing the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.


 Example :

Input:

arr = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

Output: 
4

 Explanation :

The longest consecutive sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, which has a length of 4.

 Constraints :

    Elements in arr can be any integer within
    the typical range of integers.


 Hint :
 
    Use a hash set to track elements and check for
    consecutive numbers efficiently.
