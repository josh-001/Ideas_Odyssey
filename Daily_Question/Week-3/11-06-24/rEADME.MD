Allocate Minimum Pages ðŸ“š

Problem Statement:
You are given an array arr of integers where arr[i] represents the number of pages in the i-th book. There are m students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students while meeting the following conditions:

Each student gets at least one book.
Each book can be allocated to only one student.
Book allocation must be done in a contiguous manner.
Allocate the books in such a way that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimized. If itâ€™s not possible to allocate books to all students, return -1.

Approach :
This problem can be efficiently solved using binary search with partitioning logic. The expected time complexity is O(nÃ—log(s)), where n is the number of books and s is the sum of all pages in arr.

Hint : Use binary search on the possible maximum pages a student can get. For each mid-point in this range, check if itâ€™s feasible to allocate books so that no student has more than mid pages. Adjust the range based on feasibility to find the smallest possible maximum pages allocation.
