### Problem :

An Armstrong number of n digits is an integer such that the sum of its digits each raised to the power n is equal to the number itself.


Write a program that checks if a given number n is an Armstrong number.

 Difficulty: Medium 
 Topic : Loops 


 Input :

A single integer.


 Output :

Print "Yes" if the number is an Armstrong number, and "No" otherwise.


Example:
Input:

153 --( 1^3+5^3+3^3 = 153)

Output:
Yes

Input:

123

Output:

Hints:

Find the number of digits in n to determine the power to which each digit should be raised.
