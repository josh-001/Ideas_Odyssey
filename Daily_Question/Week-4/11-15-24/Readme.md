### Introduction to Doubly Linked List 🔗 🔁

Problem Statement:

Geek is learning data structures and is curious about how to access the previous element in a linked list, just like accessing the next element. His teacher introduces him to Doubly Linked Lists.

Given an integer array arr of size n, your task is to construct a Doubly Linked List (DLL) from the array and return the head of the list.

Topic : Doubly Linked List

Difficulty :  Easy


Examples :

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 1 2 3 4 5

Explanation: The doubly linked list will be 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5.

Example 2:

Input:
n = 1
arr = [1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The doubly linked list will be 1.

Constraints :

1≤n≤10^5
1≤arr[i]≤100

Your Task:

Complete the function constructDLL() that takes arr[] as input and returns the head of the doubly linked list.

Expected Complexity:

Time Complexity:O(n)
Auxiliary Space:  O(n)
